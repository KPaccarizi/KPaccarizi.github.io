					<h2> The Kosovo War </h2>

						<cite> « 
							In 1998 and 1999, escalating conflict led to mass displacement and human rights abuses. Diplomatic efforts failed, prompting NATO's military intervention in March 1999, targeting Yugoslav military infrastructure. The war ended in June 1999 with the Kumanovo Agreement, establishing an international interim administration led by the United Nations through UNMIK. The Kosovo War remains a contentious and debated topic due to varying narratives and interpretations. » </cite>
