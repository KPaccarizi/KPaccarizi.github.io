						<h1> The origin of Kosova </h1>
						<p> Kosova originated as an inhabited region in ancient times, with Illyrian tribes settling in the area before the Roman period. It became part of the Serbian medieval state and was a center of cultural and political activity. The Battle of Kosovo in 1389 marked a significant event in the region's history, as it came under Ottoman rule afterward. Throughout history, Kosovo has been home to diverse ethnic and religious groups. In recent times, Kosovo experienced conflicts and tensions, leading to the Kosovo War and subsequent declaration of independence in 2008. The origin of Kosovo involves its ancient roots, medieval Serbian influence, Ottoman rule, and more recent historical events.</p>

						<cite> « 
							The conflict intensified in 1998 and 1999, leading to a humanitarian crisis with mass displacement of people and reports of human rights abuses. International diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution failed, resulting in NATO launching a military intervention in March 1999. The NATO bombing campaign targeted Yugoslav military and strategic infrastructure.
							
							The war ended in June 1999 with the signing of the Kumanovo Agreement, which called for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and the establishment of an international interim administration in the region. Subsequently, the United Nations established the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to govern the territory.
